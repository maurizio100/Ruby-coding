# Ruby-coding

This repo is just a repo for coding ideas. I use Ruby for solving
stuff. Actuall you can find implementations for:

* Datastructures
  * Linked List
  * Binary Search Tree
* Encryption
  * Vigniere encryption

* Shortest Knight path challenge
  * a challenge for finding the shortest path for a knight
  * [Reference to the Challenge on Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/shortest-knight-path/train/ruby)

I use this repo to sharpen my Ruby skills :-)
