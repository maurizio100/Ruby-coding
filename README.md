# Ruby-coding

This repo is just a repo for coding ideas. I use Ruby for solving
stuff. Actually you can find implementations for:

* Shortest Knight path challenge
  * a challenge for finding the shortest path for a knight

* Archery Parcours score evaluator
  * a little tool that reads a csv file with parcours scores and outputs some statistics

* Morsecode
  * a script that is able to decode morsecode into readable characters

I use this repo to sharpen my Ruby skills :-)
